# Extant

Extant is a primarily built for artists, photographers, and designers to showcase their work.  It integrates directly with the [Custom Content Portfolio](http://themehybrid.com/plugins/custom-content-portfolio) plugin for showing off your portfolio of work and the [Easy Digital Downloads](http://easydigitaldownloads.com) plugin for selling your work.

## Usage notes

Extant makes use of standard WordPress features and should require little instruction for standard usage.  However, some items should be noted.

* Mark a post as sticky to get the "large" post at the top of the home/blog page.
* Featured images are only displayed if they are at minimum 750px in width (950px for sticky posts).  This is to maintain an aesthetic consistency throughout the theme.
* Inputting a social profile link in the Primary or Secondary menu will automatically display an icon for the particular social network on the front end.

## Professional Support

If you need professional theme support from me, the theme author, you can access the support forums at [Theme Hybrid](http://themehybrid.com/support), which is a professional WordPress help/support site where I handle support for all my plugins and themes for a community of 70,000+ users (and growing).
